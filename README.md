# Firebase Opener

A little utility app to open links that redirect to Google Account selector before redirecting to the firebase console.

## Install:
- Clone the repo and checkout the code.
- Install the app in your device.


## Usage:
1. Open links to Firebase Console (`https://console.firebase.google.com/*`) from any app.
1. In the selector dialog, select `Just once` for Firebase opener:


    <img src="art/art_1.png" width=250>
1. Select appropriate Google Account where the link belongs:

    <img src="art/art_2.png" width=250>

1. This will set the session for that Google user and try to open the Firebase Console URL (`https://console.firebase.google.com/*`) again. This time, we want to select the browser again, because the session is appropriately set:

    <img src="art/art_3.png" width=250>
